# Car_Racing_Game_2D
The project is based on C Plus Plus(c++) and Glut(open gl). I use several instruction to play the game like I use SPACE button to start the game and press ESC(escape) to stop the game.
Here, I use the up button to increase speed, down to decrease speed, right to turn right, left to turn left.
After starting the game, I use the selected button to play it. In order to score, I need to pass the path without touching other cars. The more I pass  the path without touching others cars, the more I score.
There are several level in it, after completing one level, I move to the next level.

After playing the game, I get our obtained score.
